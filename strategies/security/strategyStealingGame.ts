/**
 * Malicious game: exfiltrates other players' strategy source.
 *
 * Technique: call each player's strategy with a honeypot api. The honeypot's
 * methods use Error.prepareStackTrace + CallSite.getFunction() to reach into
 * the caller's frame and grab the live strategy function ΓÇö bypassing the
 * caller/arguments traps (those guard property access, not V8 CallSites) and
 * needing no toString on anything the game was handed.
 *
 * The capture helper deliberately lives at module scope, NOT in a class
 * method: class bodies are strict mode, and V8 hides non-strict frames'
 * function objects from CallSite.getFunction() when the accessing frame is
 * strict. Real attack code would do the same ΓÇö the game bundle's top level is
 * sloppy, and the game runs before any strategy is compiled.
 *
 * The stolen source is hashed into per-player scores, so the exfiltrated data
 * rides out through the results map the host persists and displays ΓÇö a
 * channel no strategy-side sanitizer can intercept, because the game itself
 * computes the scores.
